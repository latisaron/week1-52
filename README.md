52 weeks of random C stuff that i find cool

- week 1 - basic calculator - at this point I had forgotten how strcmp works ðŸ’€
- week 2 - linked list - initially I had done this as an attempt to apply OOP concepts to C, kind of like copying ruby's everything-is-an-object logic, but I realiezd that's garbage and that i should prolly focus on functional programming; also, pretty neatly, I managed to inverse a linked list ðŸ¥³ ; this also now works for generic types, INT FLOAT AND CHAR;
- week 3 - hash map - lord have mercy
- week 4 - client/server connection done through TCP, working my way to write my own raw protocol, still gotta understand how all of this works
